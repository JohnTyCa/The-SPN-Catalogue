# The-SPN-Catalogue

## General Information

The database comprises data from 6674 individual SPN components from 2215 subjects spanning across 40 separate projects recorded since 2012. In an attempt to facilitate open-science procedures, we present here an easy-to-use tool for visualizing and exporting data from any project of interest.

This tool allows users to flexibly visualize and export data for further analysis in an attempt to remove barriers to open-science.

### If you do not have MATLAB installed

1. This tool was developed using MATLAB. However, we have compiled this tool into a standalone executable file that only requires MATLAB Runtime to run. MATLAB Runtime does not require MATLAB to be installed. MATLAB Runtime is also royalty-free, and thus, it does not require a MATLAB license to be utilized. This app only requires that you download and install the appropriate MATLAB Runtime (if not installed already). First, download the repository from the following page (including dependencies and resources):
https://github.com/JohnTyCa/The-SPN-Catalogue

Next, head to the following website to download MATLAB Runtime 9.9.

https://uk.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

2. After installing MATLAB Runtime, the data is available to be downloaded on Open Science Framework at:

https://osf.io/2sncj/

Note that the database comprises data from 40 projects requiring ~940 GB of storage, but you are free to only download the required projects - the tool will still work with a subset of the projects.

### If you have MATLAB installed

1. For those who have MATLAB already, we have also made the app available in the form of a simple MATLAB function. Simply download the repository from the following page (including dependencies and resources):

## Further Information

This tool was designed using MATLAB 2020b (9.9). However, if there are any issues with using this app for any reason, for example, if you are unable to use later versions of MATLAB, please contact us and we will aim to find a solution.

This tool was compiled on WINDOWS. Hence, it is not compatible with other operating systems at the moment.
