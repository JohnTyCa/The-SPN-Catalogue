# The-SPN-Catalogue

## General Information

This app allows you to visualise data from the Shape & Symmetry Lab with respect to the visually evoked event-related component, the Sustained Posterior Negativity (SPN).

The database comprises data from 6674 individual SPN components from 2215 subjects spanning across 40 separate projects recorded since 2012. In an attempt to facilitate open-science procedures, we present here an easy-to-use tool for visualising and exporting data from any project of interest.

## Instructions

1)  This tool was developed using MATLAB. However, we have compiled this tool into a standalone executable file that only requires MATLAB Runtime to run. MATLAB Runtime does not       require MATLAB to be installed. MATLAB Runtime is also royalty-free, and thus, it does not require a MATLAB license to be utilised.

    This app only requires that you download and install the appropriate MATLAB Runtime (if not installed already). To facilitate this, we have compiled the app using multiple         MATLAB Runtime versions to maximise compatibility. Simply download the executable file compiled using the version of MATLAB already installed on your computer. If your version     of MATLAB is not available in the list, or if you do not have MATLAB installed on your computer, please download the tool compiled with the latest version of MATLAB listed. 
    
    Next, head to the following website to download the corresponding version of MATLAB Runtime:
    
    https://uk.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

2)  After installing MATLAB Runtime, the data is available to be downloaded on Open Science Framework at:

    https://osf.io/2sncj/

    Note that the database comprises data from 40 projects requiring 2GB+ of memory, but you are free to only download the required projects - the tool will still work with a         subset of the projects.
    
3)  The data must be placed inside the "Data" folder located with the executable file. The "Data" folder will include data from each project, with each folder referring to a       single project. If the data is located elsewhere, you will be required to provide the path when the tool is opened. 

## Further Information

This tool was designed originally using MATLAB 2020b (9.9) and uses features only available in MATLAB 2019a onwards. For this reason, backwards compatibility is limited with the tool in its current state. However, if there are any issues with using this app for any reason, for example, if you are unable to use later versions of MATLAB, please contact us and we will aim to find a solution.

This tool was compiled on WINDOWS. Hence, it is not compatible with other operating systems at the moment.
