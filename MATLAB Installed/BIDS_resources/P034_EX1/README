SPN 207-209 Project 34

Half the participants discriminated whether black was symmetrical, half discriminated whether white was symmetrical. In the irregular comparison condition, the attended color was random, but the unattended color was same axis symmetry. Att = 1

For SPN 208, one could interpret W as 0 vs 0.25, but the difference would still be 0.25. Att = 1

For SPN 209, the unattended dots were always random. Att = 1
