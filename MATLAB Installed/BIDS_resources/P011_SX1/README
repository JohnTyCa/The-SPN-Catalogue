SPN 63-65 Supplementary Experiment 1 Project 60

Symmetry or random patterns were presented for either 150 (short), 500 (medium) or 1000 ms (long), then replaced with a random mask. The duration of the mask was inversely related to the duration of the pattern, so overall trial duration was always 2000 ms. After the mask, participants reported whether the pre-mask pattern was symmetry or random. Att = 1
