SPN 165-166 Project 26

After stimulus offset participants judged whether the patterns were green or black. One color was a used as an oddball and not included in the SPN analysis. 

For SPN 165, participants drank 0.65 ml/kg body weight of alcohol (approximately 4 shots of vodka mix) immediately before the experiment began (Att = 0).

For SPN 166, participants drank placebo that resembled alcohol immediately before the experiment began (Att = 0).
