SPN 113-115 Project 17

For SPN 113, after stimulus offset, participants reported whether the attended color (black or white) was symmetrical or random. SPN 113 was computed from conditions where the attended color was random. However, participants were still distinguishing random from symmetry. We can thus say feature attention was directed towards symmetry.  Att = 1

For SPN 114, after stimulus offset, participants reported whether the attended color (black or white) was symmetrical or random. SPN 114 was computed from conditions where the attended color was  symmetrical. Att = 1
