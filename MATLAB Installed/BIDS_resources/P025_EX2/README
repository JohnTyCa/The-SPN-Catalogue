SPN 163-164 Experiment 2 Project 25

These ‘probe stimuli’ were presented in the delay between sample and test of a delayed matched to sample experiment. 

For SPN 163, the participants held the green symmetry in memory and judged whether the test symmetry was the same as the sample (Att = 0)

For SPN 164, the participants did not have any memory requirements and only judged whether perimeter of the test display was red or blue (Att = 0).
