For SPN 160, the participants did not have any memory requirements and only judged whether perimeter of the test display was red or blue (Att = 0)

For SPN 161, the participants held shape information in visual working memory while these were presented. The judged whether one of 4 shapes had changed on the test display (Att = 0)

For SPN 162, the participants did not have any memory requirements and only judged whether perimeter of the test display was red or blue (Att = 0)
